#   This script provides easy and simple backup solution.                 #
#   It is primarily written for backing up Linux configuration files,     #
#   so called 'dotfiles'.                                                 #
#   The script's main purpose is to simplify the process of backing up    #
#   dotfiles from multiple locations and changing their names, so that    #
#   they are not hidden when viewing contents of the backup location.     #
#                                                                         #
#   How does it work?                                                     #
#   I. In the first step user should review variables used in script,     #
#      mainly $backup_dir and $backup array.                              #
#      User can edit following variables to their liking:                 #
#       $backup_dir - location to which files should be copied.           #
#       $log - location of the log file, used for logging errors.         #
#       $dots - defines whether or not to rename dotfiles in following    #
#               manner: .file => dot.file; value '1' enables this option. #
#       $backup - the most important variable of the script. It's an      #
#                 array containing paths to files and folders to back up. #
#                 Script uses rsync to copy files, so user must remember  #
#                 that trailing slash defines wheter to copy whole folder #
#                 or just its contents. With slash ( "dir/" ) only the    #
#                 contents of the catalogue will be copied, while without #
#                 it ( "dir" ) whole directory by name will be copied.    #
#                 Using rsync also allows us to pass various useful       #
#                 options to it, e.g. --include and --exclude to copy     #
#                 only selected files from a given directory.             #
#                                                                         #
#   II. Script begins with checking if backup destination exists and      #
#       creates directory if needed. Failure to do so results in          #
#       immediate termination of the program.                             #
#                                                                         #
#   III. Next step is creating or clearing a previous error log. Failure  #
#        to do so is most likely due to lack of write permission in       #
#        backup location, so the script terminates.                       #
#                                                                         #
#   IV. If renaming dotfiles is enabled, script renames them to their     #
#       original filenames. That way we won't have to copy files that are #
#       already up-to-date, thanks to using rsync.                        #
#                                                                         #
#   V.  Backing up! Script executes rsync on items from $backup array.    #
#       rsync output is supressed and all errors are written to $log.     #
#       This command must be executed like so:                            #
#         bash -c ' rsync ... '                                           #
#       That's because user can provide additional options for rsync,     #
#       which can include quote characters. Simply executing rsync        #
#       results in improperly resolved quotes that won't be parsed        #
#       correctly.                                                        #
#                                                                         #
#   VI. In the last step, if renaming dots is enabled, script finds all   #
#       files and directories in root backup directory and renames them   #
#       from ".file" to "dot.file" for easy viewing with 'ls' command     #
#       or in graphical file browser.                                     #
#                                                                         #
#   In every step the script tries to provide useful output.              #
